# Streaming Exploration

This sister project to [hadoop-exploration](https://github.com/lestermartin/hadoop-exploration "hadoop-exploration") is focused on *exploring* Streaming frameworks.  I'm starting with a focus on [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org "Storm"); specifically [Storm 1.1.0](http://storm.apache.org/releases/1.1.0/index.html "Storm 1.1.0").

For a test environment, I'm leveraging the [HDF 3.0 Sandbox](https://hortonworks.com/downloads/#sandbox "HDF Sandbox") for VirtualBox with filename of `HDF_3.0_virtualbox_12_06_2017_22_06_39_ambari_.ova` and MD5 hash of `8dd2059d4a27713fb5254ab5b49207cf`.
